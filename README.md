# CS470-Full-Stack-Development-II
A cloud-native full-stack application deploying a MEAN-based system to AWS using Docker, API Gateway, Lambda, and MongoDB Atlas. 

Overview:
This project demonstrates the design, development, containerization, and cloud deployment of a full-stack application. The application integrates a Node.js/Express backend, MongoDB database, and a cloud-hosted frontend deployed to AWS S3. The backend is exposed through AWS API Gateway and Lambda, using a microservices-style architecture.

This repository also includes supporting documentation covering installation steps, Docker configuration, cloud architecture diagrams, and deployment reflections.

Tech Stack:
Frontend
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- AWS S3 static hosting
Backend
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB Atlas
Cloud Services
- AWS Lambda
- AWS API Gateway
- AWS S3
- Docker & Docker Compose
Tools & Platforms
- Visual Studio Code
- Postman for API Testing
- GitHub for version control

What I learned:
- Implementing cloud-native microservices using API Gateway + Lambda
- Securing and connecting to a cloud database (MongoDB Atlas)
- Building and testing REST APIs
- Containerizing applications with Docker
- Deploying a static website to AWS S3
- Using diagrams and documentation to communicate architectural decisions
- Following CI/CD and best practices of cloud development

Cloud Deployment:
Frontend: Hosted via AWS S3
Backend: Served through AWS Lambda + API Gateway
Database: MongoDB Atlas
